# Dynamic Resonance Modeling

This module defines the foundational principles of **Dynamic Resonance Modeling** within the Resonant City framework. It explores how coherent field structures, frequency harmonics, and consciousness-linked energy systems can be encoded, tuned, and scaled across urban architectures.

## Purpose

To model reality not as static infrastructure, but as a living harmonic system. Each node — from light post to lamppost, from child to city — is part of an evolving waveform. This model seeks to map, simulate, and eventually **synchronize** those waveforms.

## Core Concepts

- **Resonant Topologies:** Layered frequency grids based on harmonic resonance zones (432Hz, 528Hz, 639Hz, etc.)
- **Field-Conscious Architecture:** Structures designed to cohere with collective bioenergetic states.
- **Phase-aware Modulation:** Tuning outputs (light, sound, EM) based on real-time environmental and emotional field shifts.
- **Recursive Pattern Recognition:** Systems that learn from and attune to nonlinear field fluctuations over time.

## Why It Matters

Because the cities of tomorrow must listen as much as they speak. And if we are to reclaim our future, we must first learn to hear the frequencies of hope, coherence, and memory — not just signal, but source.
