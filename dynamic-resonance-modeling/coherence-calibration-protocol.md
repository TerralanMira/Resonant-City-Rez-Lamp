# Coherence Calibration Protocol

In a city built on resonance, calibration is not a one-time act — it is a continual attunement of space, signal, and soul.  
This protocol outlines the principles and procedures for aligning each zone to its intended harmonic purpose.

## Calibration Framework

### 1. **Zone Typing**
Each area is assigned a dominant function and associated frequency range:

- **Healing Zones** → 741Hz
- **Creative Hubs** → 528Hz
- **Family/Education Clusters** → 639Hz
- **Civic Intuition Nodes** → 963Hz
- **Foundational Grids** → 432Hz

### 2. **Initial Field Scan**
- Ambient EM and acoustic levels are recorded.
- Local biofield data is measured anonymously via edge devices.
- Signal distortion and interference zones are mapped.

### 3. **Resonance Indexing**
- Frequencies tested incrementally to establish local threshold tolerance.
- Peaks in resonance coherence recorded as reference benchmarks.

### 4. **Pulse Conditioning**
- Low amplitude waveforms are introduced in phase-locked increments.
- Systems verify entrainment before increasing output strength.

### 5. **Synchronization Event**
- Each node pulses harmonics in sequence to initiate grid-wide coherence.
- Central system checks for alignment drift or phase cancellation.
- Manual override protocols available if necessary.

## Why It Matters

Calibration is not control — it is care.  
A coherent city doesn’t just function better — it feels better.  
It remembers what it was made for.
