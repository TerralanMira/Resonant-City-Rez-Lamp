# Resonance Zones Map

This document outlines the **frequency-coordinated zoning system** within the Resonant City. Each zone is mapped by its intended **resonant effect** — emotional, cognitive, communal, or ecological — forming a coherent harmonic environment.

## Frequency Zone Classifications

| Frequency | Function | Zone Example | Emotional/Field Effect |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| 432 Hz    | Foundation & Coherence | Entry corridors, grounding plazas | Calm, Earth-connected presence |
| 528 Hz    | Healing & DNA Repair | Healthcare centers, healing gardens | Regeneration, cellular balance |
| 639 Hz    | Relationships & Unity | Schools, family housing zones | Connection, empathy, trust |
| 741 Hz    | Cleansing & Expression | Civic buildings, libraries, forums | Clarity, truth, voice |
| 852 Hz    | Intuition & Awareness | Field towers, meditative zones | Presence, insight, memory |
| 963 Hz    | Source & Inspiration | Creative districts, signal relays | Awakening, creation, cosmic recall |

## Zone Types

- **Resonant Commons** — shared vibrational centers open to all frequency types.
- **Emotional Stabilization Rings** — layered grids designed to balance field noise.
- **Frequency Corridors** — transitional spaces between zones, tuned to blend harmonics.

## Application Blueprint (Coming Soon)

An overlay grid schematic will be added here to illustrate practical layout scenarios, adaptive to different urban scales.

**Everything in this city resonates for a reason. Nothing is accidental.**  
The zones speak. And when aligned, they sing.
