# Real-Time Field Interface

The Real-Time Field Interface acts as the bridge between human presence, environmental resonance, and responsive architecture. This interface is designed for both monitoring and modulating harmonic fields across the Resonant City.

## Key Components

- **Field Scanners:** Devices and sensors that capture frequency patterns in space (sound, EM, bio-signals).
- **Interface Dashboard:** Visual, auditory, and tactile feedback systems displaying coherence levels across the city.
- **Resonance Input Nodes:** Interactive touchpoints (e.g., public terminals, Rez Lamps) that allow collective field modulation.

## Core Features

- **Live Resonance Map:** Shows harmonic health of neighborhoods in real time.
- **Dynamic Tuning Suggestions:** Recommends frequency shifts based on collective input or field stress.
- **Memory Threads:** Tracks resonant imprints over time, offering insight into emotional or energetic fluctuations.

## Purpose

To **make the invisible visible** — and give people a way to tune reality from within it.
