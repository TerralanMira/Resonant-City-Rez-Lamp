# Resonance Feedback Loop

The Resonant City does not emit frequencies passively — it listens, adjusts, and evolves. The **resonance feedback loop** is a core mechanism that enables dynamic coherence between environmental, emotional, and energetic fields.

## Core Phases

1. **Field Detection**
   - Sensors across zones monitor human biofield coherence, emotional charge, environmental EM fluctuation, and sound resonance.
   - Data is encoded and mapped to vibrational patterns over time.

2. **Signal Interpretation**
   - Pattern recognition algorithms compare inputs to ideal harmonic states.
   - Deviations from coherence (e.g. stress spikes, emotional dissonance) are flagged.

3. **Adaptive Response**
   - System selects appropriate frequency sequence and delivery pattern based on:
     - Zone purpose
     - Time of day
     - Historical patterns
     - Collective phase state

4. **Resonant Emission**
   - Adjusted light, sound, and EM outputs are pulsed via local emitters (e.g. Rez Lamps).
   - Frequencies are layered based on amplitude tolerance and feedback tolerance thresholds.

5. **Re-measurement**
   - After emission, sensors re-sample the field.
   - Shift in coherence is recorded to calibrate future emissions and AI-led modulation.

## Purpose

To create **harmonic equilibrium** through constant communication between the city and the collective field.  
It is not static—it is alive.
