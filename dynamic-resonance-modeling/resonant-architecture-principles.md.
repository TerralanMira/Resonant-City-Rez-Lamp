# Resonant Architecture Principles

This file outlines the foundational design tenets of Resonant Architecture — structures that do not merely shelter, but attune. Buildings become tuning forks, public spaces become harmonizers, and infrastructure becomes memory.

## Core Principles

- **Harmonic Geometry:** Use of sacred geometries and proportional ratios to anchor form to field.
- **Material Resonance:** Selection of building materials based on vibrational qualities and conductivity.
- **Open Pathways:** Layouts that follow energy meridians, allowing flow rather than blockage.
- **Frequency Embedding:** Incorporation of ambient frequencies (e.g., 432Hz, 528Hz) through form, sound, or light.

## Structural Functions

- **Lampposts as Emitters:** Rez Lamps act as frequency transmitters, anchoring coherence into public space.
- **Walls as Reflectors:** Surfaces engineered to reflect and amplify desired emotional wavelengths.
- **Hubs as Harmonics:** Intersections, parks, and domes act as amplifiers and memory nodes.

## Ethos

A structure is no longer built merely for permanence—but for phase alignment. Architecture becomes living memory, coded in rhythm and form.
