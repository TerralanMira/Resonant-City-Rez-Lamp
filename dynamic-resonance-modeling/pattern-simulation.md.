# Pattern Simulation

This file explores the simulation of vibrational patterns across the Resonant City grid, modeling how frequency shifts affect city-wide coherence, energy flow, and social-emotional states.

## Objectives

- Simulate how field shifts affect specific resonance zones.
- Model how frequency changes ripple across interconnected nodes.
- Visualize how energy inputs (e.g., light, tone, movement) influence field alignment.

## Components

- **Input Variables:** Frequency, phase, source point, environmental context.
- **Propagation Model:** Uses harmonic mathematics to simulate field resonance.
- **Feedback Loops:** Adjustments based on node response and coherence readings.

## Future Expansion

- Incorporate real-time data (biosensors, EM fields, weather).
- Interface with adaptive AI for real-time frequency tuning.
- Extend simulation beyond individual cities into regional resonance forecasting.

This is the choreography of coherence. The code behind the hum.
