# Resonance-Adaptive Algorithms

This file outlines the development of adaptive algorithms that tune environmental systems in real time based on field conditions, human coherence, and harmonic baselines.

## Core Logic

- **Signal Detection:** Read ambient frequencies from sensors, Rez Lamps, or local devices.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify shifts in emotional, ecological, or electromagnetic fields.
- **Phase Alignment:** Adjust outputs (light, sound, color, EM) to re-establish harmonic balance.

## Algorithmic Functions

- **Feedback Loops:** Systems learn from human interaction and emotional resonance signatures.
- **Resonant Prediction:** Anticipate dissonance and adjust city responses preemptively.
- **Coherence Synchronization:** Align zone frequencies based on collective wellbeing markers.

## Modular Intent

These are not algorithms of control — they are algorithms of coherence. Designed not to dominate the field, but to **listen** to it.
