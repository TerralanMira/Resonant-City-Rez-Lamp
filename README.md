**Dissolve the box. Restore memory. Resonate truth.**

## Overview

This repository is the first open-source initiative of the **Resonant City** blueprint—focusing on the **Rez Lamp**: a cognitive and harmonic infrastructure node designed to restore coherence to the built environment.

## Objectives

- Release open-source schematics of Rez Lamps
- Align frequency design to support healing, clarity, kinship, and expanded perception
- Serve as the first modular node in a broader resonant urban network

## Frequency Framework

| Frequency (Hz) | Function                  |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| 432            | Natural harmony, grounding |
| 741            | Cellular detox, healing   |
| 528            | DNA repair, transformation |
| 639            | Kinship, family, learning |
| 963            | Crown awareness, vision   |
